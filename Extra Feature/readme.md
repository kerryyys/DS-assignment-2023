###Extra Feature 1 -- Another One Bite of Dust
Requirements
● Create a new option Another One Bites the Dust in Angelo Rock.
● A player can enter the path of locations Yoshikage Kira remembered he went through.
● The system should display whether the Bites the Dust ability has been activated.
● If so, the system should display the longest non-overlapping path of consecutive
locations that are repeated at least twice in the original path, as Bites the Dust was most
likely to be activated when Kira passed through them.
● The path should consist of more than one location.
● If there are multiple paths with the same longest length, the system would display any of
the paths.

● A player can enter the initial location where both DIO and Pucci begin in the first turn.

● The game terminates when Pucci reaches the same location as DIO.

● The system should display the shortest path, which starts from Rohan’s home (Morioh Grand Hotel) and includes all the locations specified, with the total distance.
